Pedro Neto delivered another blow to Arsenal's Premier League title aspirations as the Chelsea winger's stunning goal secured a 1-1 draw in the London derby on Sunday.

Mikel Arteta's team had taken the lead with Gabriel Martinelli's goal in the second half at Stamford Bridge.

However, Neto's equalizer 10 minutes later earned Chelsea a well-deserved point and left Arsenal without a win in their last four league matches.

This was Neto's first Premier League goal since his transfer from Wolves in August, keeping third-placed Chelsea ahead of fourth-placed Arsenal on goal difference.

Both teams are nine points behind leaders Liverpool. While Chelsea can be pleased with their position under Enzo Maresca's management in his first season, Arsenal face the international break grappling with questions about their recent struggles.

After a 1-0 defeat by Inter Milan in the Champions League on Wednesday, following last weekend's loss to Newcastle, Arsenal have only won three of their last nine league games.

In their pursuit of a first title since 2004, following second-place finishes to Manchester City in the past two seasons, Arsenal are missing the fluidity that brought them close to the trophy last season.

Their only victories in the last seven matches across all competitions were against Shakhtar Donetsk in Europe and second-tier Preston in the League Cup.

Maresca has frequently stated that Chelsea are not yet ready to challenge for the title, but the Italian has laid a solid foundation since taking over the underperforming club.

While they could not secure their first home win against Chelsea in six years, Maresca's young team seems to be moving in the right direction.

Cole Palmer, a key player for Maresca, forced a save from David Raya with a 25-yard shot that the Arsenal goalkeeper tipped over.

Dropping deep to take possession in midfield, Palmer led several Chelsea counter-attacks, with Malo Gusto's shot being blocked and Noni Madueke's header going wide.

Gusto should have put Chelsea ahead midway through the first half when Neto's nimble footwork set up a pin-point cross that Ben White headed over from close range.

Chelsea had imposed their will on Arsenal with a tenacious performance, featuring several robust challenges.

However, their tendency to overplay from their goal kicks almost proved costly when Levi Colwill's sloppy pass led to Martinelli forcing a good save from Robert Sanchez.

Martin Odegaard, making his first start for Arsenal since August 31 after returning from an ankle injury, nearly set up the opening goal when his quick free-kick found Kai Havertz, who scored past Sanchez. However, a VAR check showed Havertz was narrowly offside.

Chelsea continued to have the better chances, with Wesley Fofana volleying over from Madueke's cross early in the second half.

Arsenal persisted and eventually took the lead on the hour mark. Odegaard created space on the edge of the Chelsea area and delivered a sublime pass to the unmarked Martinelli, whose close-range shot beat Sanchez.

Inspired by their captain, Jurrien Timber almost doubled Arsenal's lead with a powerful run, but his low shot went just wide.

However, Arsenal's lead was short-lived. Maresca's tactical adjustment paid off in the 70th minute when Neto, moved to the right flank, cut inside and unleashed a low strike from 25 yards that arrowed into the bottom corner, leaving Arteta frustrated.
